Thorny vines, thick as a man's arm, strangle the stone walls, and the air around it hums with a palpable sense of dread. Inside, dust motes dance in the slivers of moonlight that pierce the gloom, illuminating cobweb-draped furniture and the spectral remnants of a tragic past. Each room whispers with the memories of its former inhabitants, their sorrow, rage, and despair clinging to the very fabric of the house like a shroud.",

Now, as a disembodied spirit yourself, you are drawn to places of intense psychic residue, seeking to understand the lingering echoes of the living and the dead. You possess the unique ability to perceive spiritual energy, interact with objects through telekinesis, and communicate with other entities, though your powers are limited by your own spiritual cohesion.",

Your 'eyes' are two points of faint, pulsing blue light, and your ethereal 'body' shimmers with residual energy, leaving a faint trail of cold mist in your wake. You can phase through solid objects, but the stronger the material, the more effort it takes, leaving you momentarily drained.",

A massive, cobweb-shrouded chandelier hangs precariously overhead, its crystals long since shattered. To your left, a grand staircase, its banister splintered and broken, ascends into darkness. To your right, a heavy oak door, scarred and weathered, seems to lead to a more private wing of the manor. Directly ahead, a pair of imposing, rotting double doors, their hinges rusted through, stand slightly ajar, offering a glimpse into the manor's decaying heart."

A decaying grand piano sits silently in one corner, its keys yellowed and broken."

Moonlight filters weakly through a cracked stained-glass window, casting eerie patterns on the marble floor."

Tattered remnants of velvet curtains hang from tall, arched windows, and the ghostly outlines of long-vanished furniture can be seen on the floor. A decaying grand piano sits silently in one corner, its keys yellowed and broken."

Dust sheets drape over what were once magnificent pieces of furniture, creating ghostly silhouettes. A massive, tarnished chandelier hangs precariously from the ceiling, its crystals long since lost. Moonlight filters weakly through a cracked stained-glass window, casting eerie patterns on the marble floor."

The walls are lined with shelves holding an array of peculiar objects: stoppered glass vials filled with dark liquids, dusty leather-bound tomes with unreadable script, and strange, intricately carved bone artifacts. In the center of the room, a pedestal supports a pulsating, amethyst-like crystal that emits a faint, eerie light. The air crackles with an almost imperceptible energy."

The painted eyes of the manor's former inhabitants seem to follow his every move, their silent judgment a palpable weight. Drawn by a faint, melancholic energy, Elias reaches out a translucent hand towards a withered black rose lying on a dusty pedestal. The spectral bloom crumbles slightly at his touch, yet he manages to grasp it, a fragile symbol of loss now added to his spectral inventory."

Inside, dust motes dance in the slivers of moonlight that pierce the gloom, illuminating cobweb-draped furniture and the spectral remnants of a tragic past.

A decaying grand piano sits silently in one corner, its keys yellowed and broken."

A faint, roseate glow emanated from the union, transforming the melancholic charm into _Willow's Heart Locket_. The engraved willow on its surface now wept tears of faint, shimmering light, a poignant testament to a rediscovered purpose, hinting at forgotten passages and matters of the heart yet to be unlocked within the manor's oppressive silence."
