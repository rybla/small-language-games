                "description": "Blackwood Manor stands silhouetted against a bruised, twilight sky, its once-grand facade now a ruin of decaying wood and shattered glass. Thorny vines, thick as a man's arm, strangle the stone walls, and the air around it hums with a palpable sense of dread. Inside, dust motes dance in the slivers of moonlight that pierce the gloom, illuminating cobweb-draped furniture and the spectral remnants of a tragic past. Each room whispers with the memories of its former inhabitants, their sorrow, rage, and despair clinging to the very fabric of the house like a shroud.",

Now, as a disembodied spirit yourself, you are drawn to places of intense psychic residue, seeking to understand the lingering echoes of the living and the dead. You possess the unique ability to perceive spiritual energy, interact with objects through telekinesis, and communicate with other entities, though your powers are limited by your own spiritual cohesion.",
                    "appearanceDescription": "You are a spectral investigator, a wispy form of translucent ectoplasm, vaguely humanoid in shape. Your 'eyes' are two points of faint, pulsing blue light, and your ethereal 'body' shimmers with residual energy, leaving a faint trail of cold mist in your wake. You can phase through solid objects, but the stronger the material, the more effort it takes, leaving you momentarily drained.",

Moonlight streams through a gaping hole in the ceiling, illuminating a thick carpet of dust and fallen plaster. A massive, cobweb-shrouded chandelier hangs precariously overhead, its crystals long since shattered. To your left, a grand staircase, its banister splintered and broken, ascends into darkness. To your right, a heavy oak door, scarred and weathered, seems to lead to a more private wing of the manor. Directly ahead, a pair of imposing, rotting double doors, their hinges rusted through, stand slightly ajar, offering a glimpse into the manor's decaying heart."
