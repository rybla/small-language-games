It feels as though moments stretch into eternities within these walls. The upward-flowing sand of the hourglass seems to beckon, promising a glimpse into moments yet to come, or perhaps a reversal of what has passed. Strange, geometric patterns are subtly inlaid into the black stone, visible only when your eyes adjust to the profound darkness.",

The only illumination comes from a single, colossal hourglass in the center of the room, its sands a deep, viscous crimson. The sands flow not downwards, but upwards, defying gravity. The silence here is absolute, pressing in on your ears."

The combined object, now the Locket of Bound Keys, feels heavy and potent in Corbin's hand, whispering of secrets unlocked and anchors forged."
