The air crackles with electromagnetic interference, and the omnipresent hum of cybernetic augmentation is the city's constant heartbeat.

Towering arcologies pierce the perpetually smog-choked sky, their surfaces plastered with holographic advertisements that paint the rain-swept streets in a kaleidoscope of garish colors. Below the gleaming chrome and pulsating neon of the upper sectors lies the Undercity, a labyrinth of grimy alleys, overcrowded markets, and forgotten infrastructure where the dispossessed and defiant carve out a precarious existence. The air crackles with electromagnetic interference, and the omnipresent hum of cybernetic augmentation is the city's constant heartbeat. Corporations rule this domain with an iron fist, their influence extending from the data-rich sky-scrapers down to the bio-luminescent fungi that grow in the deepest sewers.",
