The air thrums with an unseen energy, a resonant hum that seems to emanate from the very stone. Drawn by a sense of profound antiquity, Kaelen reaches for the Granite Tablet resting on a pedestal. However, as their fingers brush against the weathered stone, it becomes immediately apparent that the tablet is impossibly heavy, fused to its resting place by the sheer weight of ages. Kaelen's attempt to lift it proves futile, the tablet remaining firmly rooted as if an intrinsic part of the chamber's foundation."
