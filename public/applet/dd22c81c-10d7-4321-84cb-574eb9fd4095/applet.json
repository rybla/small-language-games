        "appearanceSpecification": "The applet uses a vibrant and cheerful color palette dominated by banana yellow and fresh green, with plenty of white space to create a clean and airy feel. The background is a soft off-white.

All images are high-quality, bright, and appealing. Icons are simple, flat, and use the primary color scheme. The layout is a single-column, top-to-bottom design, with clear separation between sections achieved through colored background blocks and ample padding.",
