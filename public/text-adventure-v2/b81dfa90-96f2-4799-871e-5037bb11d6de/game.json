While primarily a scientific outpost, a strange phenomenon has emerged: the cultivation of a unique variety of banana, known as the 'Lunana,' possesses peculiar magical properties. These properties are harnessed by the colonists for various purposes, from powering their habitats to creating ephemeral art. The lunar dust, imbued with residual cosmic energy and traces of Lunana sap, hums with latent power, waiting to be tapped.",
