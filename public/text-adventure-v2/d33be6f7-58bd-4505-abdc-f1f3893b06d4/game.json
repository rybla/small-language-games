        "description": "Dust motes dance in the weak torchlight that cuts through the oppressive gloom of the Crumbling Crypts of Xylos. Once a magnificent tomb for a forgotten sorcerer-king, the crypts have long since fallen into ruin, their stone halls choked with debris and infested with creatures of the dark. Cobwebs hang like tattered banners from vaulted ceilings, and the air is thick with the smell of damp earth and something faintly, disturbingly sweet. Every shadow seems to writhe with unseen life, and the silence is broken only by the drip, drip, drip of unseen water and the adventurer's own ragged breath.",

A faded, dark blue scarf is tied loosely around their neck, offering a splash of muted color against the muted tones of their attire. Their short, dark hair is unkempt, framing a face that bears the subtle markings of someone accustomed to hard work and long journeys. Their eyes, sharp and observant, constantly scan their surroundings.",

They are not overly talkative, preferring action to words, but possess a sharp wit and a surprisingly dry sense of humor that surfaces in tense moments. While independent and self-reliant, they are not entirely without empathy, though they tend to express it through deeds rather than declarations.",

Faint, flickering light emanates from a single, sputtering torch set in a rusty bracket on the west wall, casting long, dancing shadows that play tricks on the eyes. Cobwebs, thick as felt, drape from the high, arched ceiling, and the floor is a mess of fallen stones and grit. In the center of the room, a pile of recently disturbed rubble suggests a recent collapse or excavation. Passages lead off in several directions: a grand, arched doorway to the north, a narrow, jagged opening to the south, and a more natural-looking fissure to the east."

The air here is slightly less stale than in the antechamber, carrying a whisper of a dry, ancient scent, like desiccated parchment. The corridor continues onward, disappearing into the deeper darkness. To the south, the sturdy wooden door provides a passage back to the antechamber."
