        "description": "In the sun-scorched ruins of civilization, a new order has emerged, one forged in the crucible of potassium and peel. Decades after the Great Blight, the remnants of humanity survive in scattered enclaves, each vying for control of the sacred Banana Groves.  These groves are not mere sources of sustenance, but the very font of arcane power.  Whispers tell of Banana Shamans who can conjure storms of fruit, conjure shields of fibrous peel, and even commune with the Great Ape spirits of ages past.  Survival hinges not on salvaged technology or brute strength, but on mastering the subtle and surprisingly potent art of banana magic, a chaotic force that both sustains and destroys.",
